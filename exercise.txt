1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.
2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?
3.  What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?

1. Terminal is where users can execute a variety of absolute commands in a space likened to the brain of MacOS devices. Terminal houses all of the files on a MacOS device and has no GUI, so it lacks many features but allows for a more streamlined experience for more complex code to be executed.

2. Git is the distributed local version control system on your device that allows the entire copy of code to be stored on a device and saved before pushing to GitHub, or the web based system that stores saved code. Put simply, Git is a local device tool for code and GitHub is the online storage facility.

3. To fork a GitHub repository, you authorize your login, by using "gh auth login" in terminal.
Next, you clone the fork to your device using "gh repo fork <repository_url> --clone" in terminal as the next step.
Finally, you repo the fork in terminal using the exact url of your GitHub repo using "gh repo fork https://github.com/(url path to your repo) --clone"
